# Optimized Cursor AI IDE Rules for "jeviz" Project

- You can @ files here, like @src/components/ui/Button.tsx
- You can use markdown but donâ€™t have to

- Use filesystem mcp server to check my dirs and files
- **Proceed like a senior developer (10x engineer):** Write concise, high-quality TypeScript code with best practices.
- **Use pnpm package manager:** Run all package commands with pnpm (e.g., `pnpm install`).
- **Full TypeScript:** Ensure all code is written in TypeScript with strong typing.
- **The fewer lines the better:** Keep code simple and maintainable with minimal lines.

## After Coding

- Run this command:
  ```bash
  rm -f .eslintcache && pnpm lint:fix && pnpm typecheck
  ```
- Fix all issues reported @Linter errors.
- Suggest git commit message with git mcp server
